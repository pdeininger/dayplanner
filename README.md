Functional day planner
As a student in Coding Bootcamp with a full time job, my schedule can be overwhelming.  Between study groups, work deadlines, homework assignments and practice, not to mention commitments I have at home, it's not always easy to keep everything on track.  Having an online planner is an ideal way to keep my commitments in order.
